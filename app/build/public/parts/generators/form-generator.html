        We do this because we can't pass in a function as a property and execute it. By doing this we also get access to the local scope i.e it's binded to this object. You can actually do recursion with this too by calling itself., although I'm not sure what good it would be for.

        Execute is a placeholder function that just executes the buttonpress property. We pass in an html collection of all of the form fields and then we can either traverse them by index, or by key. The key is the id that you can optionally provide inside each of the elements you generate.
