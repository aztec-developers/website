#Athena
Athena is a web app template that get's you up and running really fast by using Web Components and Polymer.



#### Developer Notes
You can safely ignore:
`Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: Failed to register a ServiceWorker: The script has an unsupported MIME type ('text/html').`
Service workers aren't generated in a local development environment, therefore this won't impact anything.
