###Ideas and Concepts

####Generating Elements
I think a large focus of this project should be on generating elements. An element generator is the idea of creating a bunch of elements by passing in a list of objects to a single element. For an example of this see the generators folder located at `app/public/parts/generators`. This is useful because it keeps code terse and allows you to do cool stuff like generate entire forms on the fly very quickly.
