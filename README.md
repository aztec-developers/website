#Athena
Athena is the scaffolding for your modern web application. Athena contains a bunch of easily configured web components that most projects will need. This saves you time and let's you get to the important stuff faster.

#### Developer Notes
You can safely ignore:
`Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: Failed to register a ServiceWorker: The script has an unsupported MIME type ('text/html').`
Service workers aren't generated in a local development environment, therefore this won't impact anything.
